# Garden Monitoring System
I picked this project because I have an interest in gardening and I thought making something that lets you know when to water your plants would be useful for all gardeners.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was to get familiar with the sensor and to make a basic project that detects if there is enough moisture in the soil. There are two types of soil moisture sensors widely used - capacitive sensors and resistive sensors. Capacitive soil moisture sensors work by sensing the dissolved ions in the moisture. Resistive sensors work by measuring the amount of electricity conducted in the soil (dry soil conducts electricity poorly). I used the capacitive soil moisture sensor v1.2 because it is more accurate than its resisitive counterpart. When the sensor is in dry soil, the red LED glows and the message "Time to water your plant" is printed to the serial monitor. When the sensor is in wet soil, the green LED glows and the message "No need to water" is printed to the serial monitor. The biggest challenge I had with this first milestone was my sensor, because it wasn't giving me reliable values which casued a lot of issues. However, it suddenly started working so my overall project began working so that was relieving.
